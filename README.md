# Hasan Ahmed

I'm an AI/ML applied researcher with interest in applying reasoning in LLMs, reasoning engines, and more.

I'm also a hobbyist in customizing CUDA kernels, and the overall GPU architecture specifically, Nvidia Hopper (H100, H200) and Ampere (A100) variants, whilst learning more about the newer Blackwell architecture.
