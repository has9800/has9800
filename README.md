I'm an AI/ML applied researcher with interest in applying reasoning in LLMs via RL, reasoning engines, and linguistic/reasoning models (Tree-of-Though, Graph-of-Thought, Hypothesis Reasoning, etc). 

I'm also fluent in customizing CUDA kernels, and the overall GPU architecture specifically, Nvidia Hopper (H100, H200) and Ampere (A100) variants, whilst learning more about the newer Blackwell architecture.
